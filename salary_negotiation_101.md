This blog is totally candidate centric. Read till the end, It's really worth reading

Please do remember that HR's are just doing their job, So always be humble & polite while talking to them irrespective of whatever they offer and most of the times they are someone who just acts as the communication medium who carries numbers between hiring manager & candidate.

## When HR asks about current salary, you can say below things if you feel your current compensation is super low :\ 90% of the times try not to disclose your current TC by using below phrases

-   I'd prefer to keep this information private to respect my current company policies.
-   My current employer made it very clear that my salary information is confidential and I respect that. How shall we proceed?
-   I'm not very comfortable by sharing my current TC
-   Never lie about your current compensation

You can tell above things, but if HR still insists you to tell and says like we can't move forward without discussing about your current TC then you don't have an option but to tell them.

## When HR asks about expected salary:

-   (If had to) Always try to tell your expected salary after all the interviews
-   You can ask the range of the salary they can offer for that role and you can say the highest number of that range as your expected salary
-   You can delay answering this by saying, I feel it's too early to discuss about salary as i wanted to know more about the clear in depth tech understanding about the role before thinking about expected salary
-   Do research across various online sources like Leetcode, teamblind, levels.fyi, Indeed, Payscale, 6figr, AmbitionBox(outdated), Gfg (outdated). For outdated you can assume to increase 30-40% from the values mentioned all those sites try to pick the maximum number.
-   Keep in mind of your worth, your confidence, your education (tier 1/2/3), your past companies, skillset, market value of the role, usual package the company offers for the role, work location(bangalore is super costlier than something like ahmedabad)

## When you put yourself in a situation where you told less expected salary and you read this blog later

-   You can say, Sorry back then my understanding for the requirements for this post was not precise but after having clear understanding from the interviewers/hiring manager i think this is the market value for this particular post.

## During Negotation, The phrases you can use:\ HR usually asks why do you need that much hike?, Then you can answer

-   I did lot of research, I think that's the market value for my skillset and the role you're offering. I think i did extremely well in my interviews.
-   I think that's the value that i bring to the team
-   When HR says i'm giving you 50% hike but when your current TC is low , you can say "I'm not looking for hike, I'm just trying to match my skillset, Don't you think your company would be the best place which matches my skillset?"
-   When HR gives just 30-40% hike, You can say "Why would i look to switch for such small hike, In my next appraisal I will get 30% hike around. I was expecting 80% hike in this switch as i would like to stay with the company for 5+ years"
-   If you can offer X, I'm on board
-   I just put myself that's the minimum bar for this switch
-   I'm expecting XX. but what you're offering is not even close
-   HR: but you told you're expecting XX, I told as that's the base and i was expecting lot of variables, joining bonus, stocks, other random components.
-   Always keep in mind how your interview went, your yoe and your research across various sites on the role tihs particular company is providing

## Few things to be noted:

-   Research says that negotiating on fridays are really really goes in candidate way (highly recommended). So schedule your negotiation/HR rounds on friday.
-   You should be selfish without thinking about the company. Keep 2 offers till the last before day if in case if your offer gets rescinded as it's happening during recession now.
-   Always be humble, polite and very confident while negotiation
-   Make it clear to the HR that you're surely going to join the company. Show some excitement, Ask lot of questions. Show them that you're very passionate about the company
-   Always ask in how many days you can expect the offer letter
-   Feel free to reach out to 4-5 random people in linkedin of the same company(who joined recently<6months) of the same role to ask their compensation(although 80% people deny to tell) & about company as well and if he has joined very back then his salary might be low so you can increase the numbers yourself
-   Each and every component is negotiable ofcourse except relocation bonus
-   Ask 40% more than what you see in glassdoor, ambitionbox as they are usually outdated
-   It's okay to have multiple offers & negotiate one top of the other. You should be selfish.
-   Always keep yourself a minimum bar salary, otherwise if you settle for low it might even affect your next switch as well. Also keep in mind how many other companies you have interviews going on/expecting to be.
-   Learn to say NO when it doesn't meet your minimum bar you set yourself for the switch. but be polite. 90% of the cases the company gets back to the candidate later on, Even after the candidate rejects due to less pay. Because it takes lot of effort, time, uncertainity for them to look for new candidate and schedule all interviews with him and get him liked by the interviewers & he should accept the off & join the company is little uncertain
-   Even if you get 100% hike, Still try to negotiate saying ki i was expecting XX base. #NeverSettle
-   When HR asks a question Always focus on the questionnaire's intent before answering, In this way you can even guess the next question & your answer and you can use backtracking to answer current question optimisedly.
-   You can't negotiate when it's on campus placement or when you have 0 years of experience(usually can't).

## Things you shouldn't say:

-   I have student loans, EMIS, ..... these shouldn't be said while negotiating because you should be negotiating based on your skills but not on your debts.
-   I have a lot of other companies trying to recruit me
